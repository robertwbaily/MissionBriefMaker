# MissionBriefMaker
A program that reads arma mission briefs and and attempts to write its own

This is a pet project of mine that imports text file mission briefs for arma co-op operations
The intention of this program is to read the files provied, and the for the program to output its own mission 
brief based on the documents provided.

if coherent enough I then plan to make a mission based of this breif and run it with my arma group
